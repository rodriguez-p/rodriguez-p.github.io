	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models have steadily gained popularity in Neuroscience research, particularly when applied to the analysis of neuroimaging data. One of the most discussed topics in this field, the neural correlates of conscious (and unconscious) information, has also benefited from these approaches, although further research is still necessary to better understand the minimal neural mechanisms that are necessary and sufficient for experiencing any conscious percept, and which mechanisms are comparable and discernible between conscious and unconscious events. The aim of this study was two-fold. First, to explore whether it was possible to decode task-relevant features from electroencephalography (EEG) signals, particularly those related to perceptual awareness. Secondly, to test whether this decoding could be improved by using time-frequency representations instead of voltage. We employed a task designed to study conscious perception in which participants were presented with near-threshold Gabor stimuli and were asked to discriminate the orientation of the grating, and report whether they had perceived it or not. Participants’ EEG signal was recorded while performing the task and was then analysed by using ML algorithms to decode distinctive task-related parameters. The results demonstrated the feasibility of decoding both the presence or absence of the stimuli, as well as participants’ reported perception, from EEG data, although the model failed to extract relevant information related to the orientation of the Gabor. We also found no evidence of unconscious perception, neither in the behavioural data nor in the classification analyses. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis of the performance of the classifier when employing either raw voltage signals or time-frequency representations, finding a substantial improvement when the latter was used to fit the model, particularly in the theta and alpha bands. These findings underscore the significant potential of ML algorithms in decoding perceptual awareness from EEG data in consciousness research tasks.},

	title = {The role of white matter variability in TMS neuromodulatory effects},
	doi = {https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4912174},
	abstract = {Background: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a widely used tool to
explore the role of focal brain regions in cognitive processing. TMS effects over
attentional processes are consistent and replicable, while at the same time
subjected to individual variability. This individual variability needs to be
understood to better comprehend TMS effects, and most importantly, its clinical
applications.
Objective/Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to explore the role of white
matter variability in TMS neuromodulatory effects in healthy participants (N=50).
Methods: A perceptual task was used, in which near-threshold stimuli were
preceded by alerting and orienting attentional cues. Continuous Theta Burst
Stimulation (cTBS) was applied over the left frontal eye field (FEF) or an active
vertex condition. White matter was explored with diffusion-weighted imaging
tractography and TBSS analysis.
Results: Behaviourally, TMS over the left FEF slowed down reaction times
(especially in the alerting task), impaired accuracy in the objective task, and
reduced the proportion of seen targets (as compared to the vertex condition).
Attentional effects increased, overall, when TMS was applied to the left FEF as
compared to the vertex condition. Correlations between white matter and TMS
effects showed i) reduced TMS effects associated with the microstructural
properties of long-range white matter pathways such as the superior longitudinal
fasciculus (SLF), and interhemispheric fibers of the corpus callosum (CC), and ii)
increased TMS effects in participants with high integrity of the CC connecting the
stimulated region with the opposite hemisphere. Additionally, variability in
attentional effects was also related to white matter, showing iii) increased alerting
effects in participants with low integrity of association, commissural, and
projection fibers, and iv) increased orienting effects in participants with high
integrity of the right SLF III.
Conclusion: All these observations highlight the importance of taking into
account individual variability in white matter for the understanding of cognitive
processing and brain neuromodulation effects.
