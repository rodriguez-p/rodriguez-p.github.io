	abstract = {Our sensory system constantly receives information from the environment and our own body. Despite our impression to the contrary, we remain largely unaware of this information and often cannot report it correctly. Although perceptual processing does not require conscious effort on the part of the observer, it is often complex, giving rise to errors such as incorrect integration of features (illusory conjunctions). In the present study, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the neural bases of feature integration in a dual task that produced ∼30\% illusions. A distributed set of regions demonstrated increased activity for correct compared to incorrect (illusory) feature integration, with increased functional coupling between occipital and parietal regions. In contrast, incorrect feature integration (illusions) was associated with increased occipital (V1–V2) responses at early stages, reduced functional connectivity between right occipital regions and the frontal eye field at later stages, and an overall decrease in coactivation between occipital and parietal regions. These results underscore the role of parietal regions in feature integration and highlight the relevance of functional occipito-frontal interactions in perceptual processing.},

	abstract = {Our sensory system is able to build a unified perception of the world, which although rich, is limited and inaccurate. Sometimes, features from different objects are erroneously combined. At the neural level, the role of the parietal cortex in feature integration is well-known. However, the brain dynamics underlying correct and incorrect feature integration are less clear. To explore the temporal dynamics of feature integration, we studied the modulation of different frequency bands in trials in which feature integration was correct or incorrect. Participants responded to the color of a shape target, surrounded by distractors. A calibration procedure ensured that accuracy was around 70\% in each participant. To explore the role of expectancy in feature integration, we introduced an unexpected feature to the target in the last blocks of trials. Results demonstrated the contribution of several frequency bands to feature integration. Alpha and beta power was reduced for hits compared to illusions. Moreover, gamma power was overall larger during the experiment for participants who were aware of the unexpected target presented during the last blocks of trials (as compared to unaware participants). These results demonstrate that feature integration is a complex process that can go wrong at different stages of information processing and is influenced by top-down expectancies.},

	abstract= {Background
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a widely used tool to explore the causal role of focal brain regions in cognitive processing. TMS effects over attentional processes are consistent and replicable, while at the same time subjected to individual variability. This individual variability needs to be understood to better comprehend TMS effects, and most importantly, its clinical applications.
Objective
Hypothesis: This study aimed to explore the role of white matter variability in TMS neuromodulatory effects on behavior in healthy participants (N=50).
Methods
Participants completed an attentional task in which orienting and alerting cues preceded near-threshold targets. Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (cTBS) was applied over the left frontal eye field (FEF) or an active vertex condition. White matter was explored with diffusion-weighted imaging tractography and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS).
Results
Behaviourally, TMS over the left FEF slowed down reaction times (especially in the alerting task), impaired accuracy in the objective task, and reduced the proportion of seen targets (as compared to the vertex condition). Attentional effects increased, overall, when TMS was applied to the left FEF as compared to the vertex condition. Correlations between white matter and TMS effects showed i) reduced TMS effects associated with the microstructural properties of long-range white matter pathways such as the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and interhemispheric fibers of the corpus callosum (CC), and ii) increased TMS effects in participants with high integrity of the CC connecting the stimulated region with the opposite hemisphere. Additionally, variability in attentional effects was also related to white matter, showing iii) increased alerting effects in participants with low integrity of association, commissural, and projection fibers, and iv) increased orienting effects in participants with high integrity of the right SLF III.
Conclusion
All these observations highlight the importance of taking into account individual variability in white matter for the understanding of cognitive processing and brain neuromodulation effects.},
