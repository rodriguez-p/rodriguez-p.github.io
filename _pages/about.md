Welcome! My name is Pablo, I'm currently a PhD researcher at the [Attention and Consciousness lab](https://blogs.ugr.es/attentionandconsciousness/) (University of Granada, Spain) under supervision of [Dr. Ana Chica](https://blogs.ugr.es/attentionandconsciousness/ana-b-chica-2/). My main interest lies in the mechanisms trough which attention and conscious perception interact, with a focus on the neural basis of this relationship. Over the last years I have worked with EEG, fMRI and TMS to get a glimpse into this processes, and my PhD project involves the use of machine learning models on EEG data with the goal of understanding how conscious and unconscious information are represented in the brain, and improving performance in perceptual tasks.

 I have also collaborated in projects [aiming to decode and synthesize speech from brain biosignals](https://aholab.ehu.eus/deeprestore/en/), with [Dr. José Andrés González-López](https://www.ugr.es/~joseangl/) and [Dr. Marc Ouellet](https://www.ugr.es/~mouellet/CV.htm), using machine learning and deep learning models.
